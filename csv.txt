Charlie Rose recently sat down for a one-on-one interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss what the Russian leader thinks of America and how the world views him.

Here's a preview of this Sunday's "60 Minutes" report:

Charlie Rose: You're much talked about in America. There's much conversation, more so than any.

Vladimir Putin: Maybe they have nothing else to do in America but talk about me. [laughs]

Rose: No, no, no, or maybe they're curious people? [laughs] Or maybe you're an interesting character? Maybe that's what it is. As you know, some have called you a czar.

Putin: So what? You know people call me different names.

Rose: But does the name fit?

Putin: No, it does not fit me. It's not important how I'm called, whether these are well-wishers, friends or political opponents. It's important what you think about you, what you must do for the interest of the country which has entrusted you with the position as the head of the Russian state.

Rose: Are you curious about America? More than simply another nation that you have to deal with?

Putin: Of course we're curious about what's going on. America exerts enormous influence on the situation in the world as a whole.

Rose: What do you admire most about America?

Putin: I like the creativity.

Rose: Creativity?

Putin: Creativity when it comes to your tackling problems. Their openness -- openness and open-mindedness -- because it allows them to unleash the inner potential of their people. And thanks to that, America has attained such amazing results in developing their country.
